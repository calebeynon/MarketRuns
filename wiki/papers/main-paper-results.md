## Abstract (one-line)

A 2×2 experimental study (liquidation payoff × communication) of the psychological predictors — emotions, traits, luck, peer cascades — of market runs in a Bernardo–Welch setting.

## Hypotheses

LaTeX `\label`s reuse `chat_treatment` for several hypotheses; numbering in the prose is inconsistent. The substantive hypotheses are:

- **H1 (emotions)**: Joy reduces selling; fear, anger, engagement increase it.
- **H2 (price treatment)**: Subjects sell less under average-price (T2) than random-price (T1) — pooling reduces variance and encourages cooperation.
- **H3 (chat)**: Subjects sell less in the chat treatment than the no-chat treatment.
- **H4 (traits)**: Less selling — agreeableness, risk tolerance, openness. More selling — impulsivity, anxiety, conscientiousness.

## Main Results

- **Cascade effects** (Table 8 / Cox): 2 or 3 prior sellers in the immediately previous period significantly raise the selling hazard despite the public signal. Total prior-sales effect is negative (price channel).
- **Lucky / unlucky liquidation payoffs** (Table 7 / `holdout_liquidation_regression`): Receiving payoff 8 vs. 2 in random liquidation makes a participant **9.23% less likely to sell next round**; coefficients monotonic in payoff.
- **Emotions** (Tables 5, 8): Joy positive but marginal in full sample, becomes negative for sellers-only. Disgust positive in sellers subsample. Valence composite significantly negative on hazard. Fear and anger NOT significant — partial contradiction of H1.
- **Personality traits** (Tables 5, 8): Conscientiousness, neuroticism, anxiety raise hazard (consistent with H4). Risk tolerance lowers hazard (marginal). Agreeableness becomes significantly negative in sellers subsample. Effects ~3× stronger in sellers-only.
- **Chat treatment** (Tables 4, 6, 8): Chat segments reduce sellers per group-round by 1.07 and 1.29 (Tobit). DiD decomposition (Table 6) isolates pure communication effect = -0.4863 sellers (marginally significant, parallel-trends p=0.7553). Supports H3.
- **Average vs. random price**: T2 *increased* sellers by 0.4952 in Tobit (Table 4) — **contradicts H2**. Cox shows no significant treatment effect.
- **Signal/round**: Higher signal sharply lowers hazard; selling falls with round number (learning).
- **Welfare** (Table 9): OLS of group-round welfare on traits, restricted to good-state (z=1) rounds, clustered at session×segment×group.
